### How to use the app:

Ski Ticketer is an app I created that give users the ability to: 

-View a list of top ski resorts in the world.

-Purchase a ski ticket to a ski resort.

-Cancel a ski ticket of theirs. 

-Edit their name.

*This app is buit so that you have to use one of the below fake user's names of your choice when you are prompted to enter your name:

Micky, Eugene, Stephen, Joy, Tom, Christina, Peter, Richard, Ben, or Mike

First you are brought to a main menu with 4 options: 

  1. View a list of the top 20 ski resorts in the world and/or purchase a ticket. 
  
    -If 1 is entered here you see a list with fake names representing 20 of the top ski resorts in the world. -You can then press 1 to go back to the main menu if you wish. 
    
    -Or, you can press 2 which will list the ski resort names again and then prompt a user to enter a valid ski resort as well as an existing user's name which will then allow them to purchase a ticket. 
    
    -The user is then brought back to the main menu.

  2. Edit a user. 
  
    -If 2 is entered on the main menu a user will be prompted to enter an existing user's name. 
    
    -Then, the user will be asked what they would like to change their name to, and their name will be changed to whatever they enter in.
    
    -The user is then brought back to the main menu.

  3. Cancel a ticket.
  
    -If 3 is entered on the main menu a user will be prompted to enter an existing user's name. 
    
    -Then, the ski resorts that this user currently has tickets for will be listed below. 
    
    -The user will then be prompted to enter the name of the ski resort that they would like to cancel their ticket for.
    
    -Given a ski resort that the user has a ticket for is entered in, the user's ticket to that ski resort will be cancelled and the user will then be brought back to the main menu.

  4. Exit the program. 
  
    -Entering 4 on the main menu will exit you out of the program.
